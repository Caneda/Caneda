Description: A Universal Circuit Simulator
 Qucs is an integrated circuit simulator which means you are able
 to setup a circuit with a graphical user interface (GUI) and simulate
 the large-signal, small-signal and noise behaviour of the circuit.
 After that simulation has finished you can view the simulation
 results on a presentation page or window.
