Installed Files<br>
</h3></center>

The Qucs system needs several programs. These are installed during
the installation process. The path of Qucs is determined during the
installation (<tt>configure</tt> script). The following explanations
assume the default path (<tt>/usr/local/</tt>).

<br><br>
<tt>/usr/local/bin/qucs&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt> - the GUI
<br>
<tt>/usr/local/bin/qucsator </tt> - the simulator (console application)
<br>
<tt>/usr/local/bin/qucsedit </tt> - a simple text editor
<br>
<tt>/usr/local/bin/qucshelp </tt> - a small program displaying the help system
<br><br>
All programs are stand-alone applications and can be started independently.
The main program (GUI)
<br>calls <tt>qucsator</tt> when performing a simulation,
<br>calls <tt>qucsedit</tt> when showing text files and
<br>calls <tt>qucshelp</tt> when showing the help system.
<br><br>
Furthermore, the following directories are created during installation:
<br>
<tt>/usr/local/share/qucs/bitmaps </tt> - contains all bitmaps (icons etc.)
<br>
<tt>/usr/local/share/qucs/docs&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt> - contains HTML documents for the help system
<br>
<tt>/usr/local/share/qucs/lang&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt> - contains the translation files
