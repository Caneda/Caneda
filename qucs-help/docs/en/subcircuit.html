Working with Subcircuits<br>
</h3></center>

Subcircuits are used to bring more clarity into a schematic. This is
very useful in large circuits or in circuits, in which a component
block appears several time.<br>
In Qucs, each schematic containing a subcircuit port is a subcircuit.
You can get a subcircuit port by using the toolbar, the components
listview (in lumped components) or the menu (Insert->Insert port).
After placing all subcircuit ports (two for example) you need to save
the schematic (e.g. CTRL-S). By taking a look into the content
listview (figure 1) you see that now there is a "2-port" right beside
the schematic name (column "Note"). This note marks all documents
which are subcircuits. Now change to a schematic where you want to
use the subcircuit. Then press on the subcircuit name (content
listview). By entering the document area again, you see that you now
can place the subcirciut into the main circuit. Do so and complete
the schematic. You can now perform a simulation. The result is the
same as if all the components of the subcircuit are placed into the
circuit directly.<br>

If you select a subcircuit component (click on its symbol in the
schematic) you can step into the subcircuit schematic by pressing
CTRL-I (of course, this function is also reachable via toolbar
and via menu). You can step back by pressing CTRL-H.
