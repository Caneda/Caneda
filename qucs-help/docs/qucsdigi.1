.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBQucs\fR is an integrated circuit simulator which means you are able
to setup a circuit with a graphical user interface (GUI) and simulate
the large-signal, small-signal and noise behaviour of the circuit.
After that simulation has finished you can view the simulation results
on a presentation page or window.

The software aims to support all kinds of circuit simulation types,
e.g. DC, AC, S-parameter, harmonic balance analysis, noise analysis,
etc.

\fBQucsDigi\fR is a wrapper script for digital simulations performed
by Qucs.  The program utilizes the \fBFreeHDL\fR compiler in order to
convert the VHDL output of Qucs into a C++ program.  Thereafter this
C++ source is compiled and linked to a binary.  This binary is then
executed and its VCD output file is converted to a Qucs dataset.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fR FILENAME
the filename of the VHDL file to be simulated
.TP
\fR TIME
duration of the digital simulation
.TP
\fR DIRECTORY
the name of the directory where the simulation is going to be performed
.SH AVAILABILITY
The latest version of Qucs can always be obtained from
\fBwww.sourceforge.net\fR or \fBwww.freshmeat.net\fR
