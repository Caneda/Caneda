Caneda is currently split into two packages, i.e. caneda (the GUI) and
caneda-core (the backend command line simulator).  In order to
distribute a complete package you need to run the distribution process
as described in both the RELEASE files up to the point where you have
the tarballs created using `make distcheck'.
