Full distribution process:
--------------------------

Qucs is currently split into two packages, i.e. qucs (the GUI) and
qucs-core (the backend command line simulator).  In order to
distribute a complete package you need to run the distribution process
as described in both the RELEASE files up to the point where you have
the tarballs created using `make distcheck'.

* Ensure you hit the current requirements.
  - Autoconf version 2.57 (at least)
  - GNU automake 1.7.0 (at least)
  - flex 2.5.31
  - GNU Bison 1.875d
  - a LaTeX installation (including IEEEtran bibstyle)
  - GNU Octave
  - epsTk 2.0.1 (at least)
  - Qt installation >= version 3.1 (by Trolltech)

* Unpack the packages in a temporary directory.
  - mkdir /temporary-dir and cd /temporary-dir
  - tar xvzf qucs-<version>.tar.gz first and then `cd qucs-<version>'
  - tar xvzf qucs-core-<version>.tar.gz and `mv qucs-core-<version> qucs-core'

* Slightly modify and rebuild package.
  - Modify the lines marked with "release specific" in `configure.ac' and
    the `Makefile.am' files.
  - Run `sh autogen.sh' first in the qucs-core directory and then in main
    directory.
  - Run `make all' and finally `make distcheck'.

* Distribute the package.
  - Upload the package to the SourceForge server and add a News item.
  - Announce the release at Freshmeat.
  - Send an announcement to <qucs-help@lists.sourceforge.net>.
