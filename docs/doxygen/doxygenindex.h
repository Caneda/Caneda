 *
 * \tableofcontents
 *
 * Caneda is an open source EDA software suite focused on ease of use and
 * portability. Its main goal is to handle the complete design process:
 * schematic capture, simulation and circuit layout or PCB. Caneda aims to
 * support all kinds of circuit simulation types, e.g. DC, AC, S-parameter and
 * harmonic balance analysis.
 *
 * Caneda is currently under a heavy development state. Any feedback is
 * welcome, from bugs, artworks to UI changes recommendations.
 *
 * Caneda is currently looking for help. If you want to help as a developer,
 * create new components to be included in the next realease or help us write
 * the manuals and documentation, don't hesitate to contact us. Your help will
 * be much appreciated.
 *
 * \section Introduction Introduction to the Main Classes
 * A good way to start developing for Caneda is going through Caneda's main
 * classes and reading the principal methods until you understand the inner
 * workings of the program.
 *
 * Caneda's main classes are MainWindow, which implements the window the user
 * interacts with, IContext, IDocument and IView which form part of Caneda's
 * Document-View framework and CGraphicsScene which provides a canvas for
 * managing graphics elements.
 *
 * \li <b>The MainWindow Class:</b> The MainWindow class is one of Caneda's
 * main classes (along with the Document-View framework composed by IContext,
 * IDocument and IView classes). This class initializes the main window of the
 * program and manages all user interface interactions.
 * \li <b>\ref DocumentViewFramework</b>: Caneda's Document-View
 * framework provides a convenient approach to model-view programming, much
 * like Qt's Graphics View Architecture. The main intent is to allow the
 * program to add any document type (vhdl, pcb, etc) without having to manually
 * change the bulk of the existing code. The main classes in Caneda's
 * Document-View framework are IContext, IDocument and IView, which must be
 * inherited to create more specific uses for each file type.
 * \li <b>The CGraphicsScene Class:</b> This class provides a canvas for
 * managing graphics elements common to all Caneda's graphics scenes
 * (schematics, symbols, layouts, etc). This is one of Caneda's most important
 * classes, along with MainWindow class and \ref DocumentViewFramework.
 *
 * Finally, you can find information on the several file formats used in
 * \ref DocumentFormats.
 *
 * \section CodingStyle Caneda Coding Style
 * Caneda uses the same coding style as Qt. Keeping the code consistant is
 * important for readability both for fixing bugs and bringing in new
 * developers. Base all dialogs on .ui files (ie create them using Qt Designer)
 * so that layouts can be perfected effectively. SaveDocumentsDialog is an
 * example for this.
 *
 * For a more in-depth guide through our coding style, please read
 * \ref CodingStylePage.
 *
 * \section Contact Contact
 * Caneda is currently looking for help. If you want to help as a developer,
 * create new components to be included in the next realease or help us write
 * the manuals and documentation, don't hesitate to contact us. Your help will
 * be much appreciated.
 *
 * Any feedback is also welcome, from bugs, artworks to UI changes
 * recommendations.
