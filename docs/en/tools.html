Caneda has several integrated tools that will help you
performing some particular task. This is a small overview
of the tools available thought the tools menu.<br>

<h3>
Caneda Filter Synthesis
</h3>
CanedaFilter is a filter synthesis tool.<br><br>
To create a filter, simply enter all parameters and press the big
button at the bottom of the main window. Immediatly, the schematic 
of the filter is calculated and put into the clipboard. Now go to 
Caneda, open an empty schematic and press CTRL-V (paste from 
clipboard). The filter schematic can now be inserted and simulated.

<h3>
Caneda Line Calculation
</h3>
CanedaTranscalc is an analysis and synthesis tool for calculating 
the electrical and physical properties of different kinds of RF
and microwave transmission lines.<br><br>
For each type of transmission line, using dialog boxes, you can
enter values for the various parameters, and either calculate its
electrical properties, or use the given electrical requirements to
synthesize physical parameters of the required transmission line.<br>
Available transmission lines are: Microstrip, Rectangular Waveguide, 
Coaxial Line and Coupled Microstrips.
<br><br>

<h3>
Caneda Attenuator Synthesis
</h3>
Caneda Attenuator is an attenuator synthesis tool.<br><br>
To create a attenuator, simply enter all the input parameters and 
press the calculation button. Immediatly, the schematic of the 
attenuator is calculated and put into the clipboard. Now go to
Caneda, open an schematic and press CTRL-V (paste from clipboard).
The attenuator schematic can now be inserted.
