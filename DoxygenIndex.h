 * \tableofcontents
 * 
 * Caneda is an open source EDA software focused on easy of use and portability.
 * While in the short term schematic capture and simulation is the primary goal,
 * in the long term future, PCB and layout edition will be covered. The software
 * aims to support all kinds of circuit simulation types, e.g. DC, AC,
 * S-parameter and harmonic balance analysis.
 * 
 * Caneda is currently under a heavy development state. It is not yet 
 * recommended for the final user and some basic functions may still be missing
 * (simulations are not yet implemented!). Bugs may arise and some nasty crashes
 * occur. However if you don't mind being an early tester, do not hesitate to
 * try it! Any feedback is welcome, from bugs, artworks to UI changes
 * recommendations. Although we're not quite ready there, we are slowly getting
 * to the point where simulation is being introduced.
 * 
 * Caneda is currently looking for help. If you want to help as a developer,
 * create new components to be included in the next realease or help us write
 * the manuals and documentation, don't hesitate to contact us. Your help will
 * be much appreciated.
 * 
 * \section Introduction Introduction to the Main Classes
 * A good way to start developing for Caneda is going through Caneda's main
 * classes and reading the principal methods until you understand the inner
 * workings of the program.
 * 
 * Caneda's main classes are MainWindow, which implements the window the user
 * interacts with, IContext, IDocument and IView which form part of Caneda's
 * Document-View framework and CGraphicsScene which provides a canvas for
 * managing graphics elements.
 * 
 * \li <b>The MainWindow Class:</b> \copybrief MainWindow
 * \li <b>\ref DocumentViewFramework</b>: Caneda's Document-View
 * framework provides a convenient approach to model-view programming, much
 * like Qt's Graphics View Architecture. The main intent is to allow the
 * program to add any document type (vhdl, pcb, etc) without having to manually
 * change the bulk of the existing code. The main classes in Caneda's
 * Document-View framework are IContext, IDocument and IView, which must be
 * inherited to create more specific uses for each file type.
 * \li <b>The CGraphicsScene Class:</b> \copybrief CGraphicsScene
 * 
 * \section CodingStyle Caneda Coding Style
 * Caneda uses the same coding style as Qt. Keeping the code consistant is 
 * important for readability both for fixing bugs and bringing in new
 * developers. Base all dialogs on .ui files (ie create them using Qt Designer)
 * so that layouts can be perfected effectively. SaveDocumentsDialog is an
 * example for this.
 * 
 * For a more in-depth guide through our coding style, please read

/*!
 * \page DocumentViewFramework Document-View framework
 * 
 * Caneda's Document-View framework provides a convenient approach
 * to model-view programming, much like Qt's Graphics View Architecture.
 * The main intent is to allow the program to add any document type (vhdl,
 * pcb, etc) without having to manually change the bulk of the existing
 * code.
 *
 * The general idea is to have a new document type implement the
 * following three interfaces (technically QObject subclasses):
 *
 *   * IContext - \copybrief IContext
 *
 *   * IDocument - \copybrief IDocument
 *
 *   * IView - \copybrief IView
 *
 * DocumentViewManager in coordination with MainWindow, Tab and TabWidget
 * classes, handle the bulk of the file open, split and close actions.
 *
 * Under this scheme, in addition to the 3 classes aforementioned, there
 * are two extra classes where most of the burden is put (for example
 * SchematicScene and SchematicView). Although conceptually these should be
 * part of the corresponding IDocument and IView class implementations
 * respectively (SchematicDocument and SchematicView in the example), there
 * are some reasons for keeping the separate.
 *
 * Initially the interface classes would just contain pure virtual
 * functions. However, in that case, signals and slots may not be used in
 * the interface unless the respective classes were a subclass of QObject.
 * Signals and slots are quite useful to model certain characteristics
 * like, for example, handling the focus of a view in DocumentViewManager
 * to update the current active view. Although hacks could be used (like
 * implementing the signal and slots only in the implementation classes and
 * connecting them by getting a QObject* representation), the interface
 * doesn't serve the purpose and we end up using two pointers for every
 * element usage (one IView* and one QObject*, for that example). The
 * classes QGraphicsScene, QTextDocument, etc, are themselves QObject
 * subclasses and subclassing them for that usage is inevitable. As such
 * one has to resort to virtual inheritance and multiple inheritance
 * everywhere. This again results in too many casts (one to interface and
 * another to one of QGraphicsScene, QGraphicsView, etc).
 *
 * That is when we realized the benefits of QtCreator's approach. They have
 * all the interface classes inherit QObject, and the implementations just
 * have to satisfy the interfaces. The bulk of the work is done in other
 * classes and the implementation just passes on the responsibility to that
 * classes wherever required (for example the undo in the interface
 * implementation invokes undo in the other class the object has used).
 * This is way more cleaner, and is the implementation chosen. Although
 * there is an increase in number of classes used, the resulting code
 * quality and readability increases a lot.

 * 
 * \section Introduction Introduction
 * 
 * Caneda uses the same coding style as Qt.  If you use the git_hooks there is
 * a pre-commit_checkstyle that will warn you of style errors.  Keeping the
 * code consistant is important for readability both for fixing bugs and
 * bringing in new developers. Base all dialogs on .ui files (ie create them
 * using Qt Designer) so that layouts can be perfected effectively.
 * SaveDocumentsDialog is an example for this.
 * 
 * \subsection Indentation Indentation
 * \li 4 spaces are used for indentation
 * \li Spaces, not tabs!
 * 
 * \subsection DeclaringVariables Declaring variables
 * \li Declare each variable on a separate line
 * \li Avoid short (e.g., a,rbarr,nughdeget) names whenever possible
 * \li Single character variable names are only okay for counters and
 * temporaries, where the purpose of the variable is obvious
 * \li Wait with declaring a variable until it is needed
 *
 * \code{.cpp}
 * // Wrong
 * int a, b;
 * char *c, *d;
 * \endcode
 * 
 * \code{.cpp}
 * // Correct
 * int height;
 * int width;
 * char *nameOfThis;
 * char *nameOfThat;
 * \endcode
 * 
 * \li Variables and functions start with a small letter. Each consecutive word
 * in a variable's name starts with a capital letter
 * \li Avoid abbreviations
 * 
 * \code{.cpp}
 * // Wrong
 * short Cntr;
 * char ITEM_DELIM = '\t';
 * \endcode
 * 
 * \code{.cpp}
 * // Correct
 * short counter;
 * char itemDelimiter = '\t';
 * \endcode
 * 
 * \li Classes always start with a big letter.
 * 
 * \subsection Whitespace Whitespace
 * \li Use blank lines to group statements together where suited
 * \li Always use only one blank line
 * \li Always use a single space after a keyword, and before a curly brace.
 * 
 * \code{.cpp}
 * // Wrong
 * if(foo){
 * }
 * \endcode
 * 
 * \code{.cpp}
 * // Correct
 * if (foo) {
 * }
 * \endcode
 * 
 * \li For pointers or references, always use a single space before * or &,
 * but never after. Exception: template parameters - use no space before and no
 * space after * or &.
 * \li No space after a cast.
 * \li Avoid C-style casts when possible.
 * 
 * \code{.cpp}
 * // Wrong
 * char* blockOfMemory = (char* ) malloc(data.size());
 * \endcode
 * 
 * \code{.cpp}
 * // Correct
 * char *blockOfMemory = (char *)malloc(data.size());
 * char *blockOfMemory = reinterpret_cast<char*>(malloc(data.size()));
 * \endcode
 * 
 * \subsection Braces Braces
 * \li As a base rule, the left curly brace goes on the same line as the start
 * of the statement:
 * 
 * \code{.cpp}
 * // Wrong
 * if (codec)
 * {
 * }
 * \endcode
 * 
 * \code{.cpp}
 * // Correct
 * if (codec) {
 * }
 * \endcode
 * 
 * \li Exception: Function implementations and class declarations always have
 * the left brace on the start of a line:
 * 
 * \code{.cpp}
 * static void foo(int g)
 * {
 *     qDebug("foo: %i", g);
 * }
 * \endcode
 * 
 * \code{.cpp}
 * class Moo
 * {
 * };
 * \endcode
 * 
 * \li Use curly braces when the body of a conditional statement contains more
 * than one line, and also if a single line statement is somewhat complex.
 * 
 * \code{.cpp}
 * // Wrong
 * if (address.isEmpty()) {
 *     return false;
 * }
 * 
 * for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
 *     qDebug("%i", i);
 * }
 * \endcode
 * 
 * \code{.cpp}
 * // Correct
 * if (address.isEmpty())
 *     return false;
 * 
 * for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i)
 *     qDebug("%i", i);
 * \endcode
 * 
 * \li Exception 1: Use braces also if the parent statement covers several
 * lines / wraps
 * 
 * \code{.cpp}
 * // Correct
 * if (address.isEmpty() || !isValid()
 *     || !codec) {
 *     return false;
 * }
 * \endcode
 * 
 * \li Exception 2: Use braces also in if-then-else blocks where either the
 * if-code or the else-code covers several lines
 * 
 * \code{.cpp}
 * // Wrong
 * if (address.isEmpty())
 *     return false;
 * else {
 *     qDebug("%s", qPrintable(address));
 *     ++it;
 * }
 * \endcode
 * 
 * \code{.cpp}
 * // Correct
 * if (address.isEmpty()) {
 *     return false;
 * } else {
 *     qDebug("%s", qPrintable(address));
 *     ++it;
 * }
 * \endcode
 * 
 * \code{.cpp}
 * // Wrong
 * if (a)
 *     if (b)
 *         ...
 *     else
 *         ...
 * \endcode
 * 
 * \code{.cpp}
 * // Correct
 * if (a) {
 *     if (b)
 *         ...
 *     else
 *         ...
 * }
 * \endcode
 * 
 * \li Use curly braces when the body of a conditional statement is empty
 * 
 * \code{.cpp}
 * // Wrong
 * while (a);
 * \endcode
 * 
 * \code{.cpp}
 * // Correct
 * while (a) {}
 * \endcode
 * 
 * \subsection Parentheses Parentheses
 * \li Use parentheses to group expressions:
 * 
 * \code{.cpp}
 * // Wrong
 * if (a && b || c)
 * \endcode
 * 
 * \code{.cpp}
 * // Correct
 * if ((a && b) || c)
 * \endcode
 * 
 * \code{.cpp}
 * // Wrong
 * a + b & c
 * \endcode
 * 
 * \code{.cpp}
 * // Correct
 * (a + b) & c
 * \endcode
 * 
 * \subsection SwitchStatements Switch statements
 * \li The case labels are on the same column as the switch
 * \li Every case must have a break (or return) statement at the end or a
 * comment to indicate that there's intentionally no break
 * 
 * \code{.cpp}
 * switch (myEnum) {
 *     case Value1:
 *         doSomething();
 *         break;
 *     case Value2:
 *         doSomethingElse();
 *         // fall through
 *     default:
 *         defaultHandling();
 *         break;
 * }
 * \endcode
 * 
 * \subsection LineBreaks Line breaks
 * \li Keep lines shorter than 100 characters; insert line breaks if necessary.
 * \li Commas go at the end of a broken line; operators start at the beginning
 * of the new line. The operator is at the end of the line to avoid having to
 * scroll if your editor is too narrow.
 * 
 * \code{.cpp}
 * // Correct
 * if (longExpression
 *     + otherLongExpression
 *     + otherOtherLongExpression) {
 * }
 * \endcode
 * 
 * \code{.cpp}
 * // Wrong
 * if (longExpression +
 *     otherLongExpression +
 *     otherOtherLongExpression) {
 * }
 * \endcode
 * 
 * \subsection ForwardDeclarations Forward declarations
 * Use forward declaration when possible. Suppose you want to define a new
 * class B that uses objects of class A. If B only uses references or pointers
 * to A, use forward declarations (you don't need to include <A.h> in the
 * header, but include it in the cpp). This will in turn speed a little bit the
 * compilation.
 * 
 * \code{.cpp}
 * class A ;
 * 
 * class B {
 *   private:
 *       A *fPtrA;
 *   public:
 *       void mymethod(const& A) const;
 * };
 * \endcode
 * 
 * B derives from A or B explicitely (or implicitely) uses objects of class A.
 * You then need to include <A.h>
 * 
 * \code{.cpp}
 * #include <A.h>
 * 
 * class B : public A{
 * 
 * };
 * 
 * class C {
 *   private:
 *       A fA;
 *   public:
 *       void mymethod(A par);   
 * }
 * \endcode
 * 
 * \section GeneralException General exception 
 * Feel free to break a rule if it makes your code look bad.
