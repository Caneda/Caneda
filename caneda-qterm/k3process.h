/**
 * @obsolete Use KProcess and KPtyProcess instead.
 *
 * Child process invocation, monitoring and control.
 * This class works only in the application's main thread.
 *
 * <b>General usage and features:</b>\n
 *
 * This class allows a KDE application to start child processes without having
 * to worry about UN*X signal handling issues and zombie process reaping.
 *
 * @see K3ProcIO
 *
 * Basically, this class distinguishes three different ways of running
 * child processes:
 *
 * @li  DontCare -- The child process is invoked and both the child
 * process and the parent process continue concurrently.
 *
 * The process is started in an own session (see setsid(2)).
 *
 * @li  NotifyOnExit -- The child process is invoked and both the
 * child and the parent process run concurrently.
 *
 * When the child process exits, the K3Process instance
 * corresponding to it emits the Qt signal processExited().
 * Since this signal is @em not emitted from within a UN*X
 * signal handler, arbitrary function calls can be made.
 *
 * Be aware: When the K3Process object gets destructed, the child
 * process will be killed if it is still running!
 * This means in particular, that it usually makes no sense to use
 * a K3Process on the stack with NotifyOnExit.
 *
 * @li  OwnGroup -- like NotifyOnExit, but the child process is started
 * in an own process group (and an own session, FWIW). The behavior of
 * kill() changes to killing the whole process group - this makes
 * this mode useful for implementing primitive job management. It can be
 * used to work around broken wrapper scripts that don't propagate signals
 * to the "real" program. However, use this with care, as you disturb the
 * shell's job management if your program is started from the command line.
 *
 * @li  Block -- The child process starts and the parent process
 * is suspended until the child process exits. (@em Really not recommended
 * for programs with a GUI.)
 * In this mode the parent can read the child's output, but can't send it any
 * input.
 *
 * K3Process also provides several functions for determining the exit status
 * and the pid of the child process it represents.
 *
 * Furthermore it is possible to supply command-line arguments to the process
 * in a clean fashion (no null-terminated stringlists and such...)
 *
 * A small usage example:
 * \code
 *   K3Process *proc = new K3Process;
 *
 *   *proc << "my_executable";
 *   *proc << "These" << "are" << "the" << "command" << "line" << "args";
 *   QApplication::connect(proc, SIGNAL(processExited(K3Process *)),
 *                         pointer_to_my_object, SLOT(my_objects_slot(K3Process *)));
 *   proc->start();
 * \endcode
 *
 * This will start "my_executable" with the commandline arguments "These"...
 *
 * When the child process exits, the slot will be invoked.
 *
 * <b>Communication with the child process:</b>\n
 *
 * K3Process supports communication with the child process through
 * stdin/stdout/stderr.
 *
 * The following functions are provided for getting data from the child
 * process or sending data to the child's stdin (For more information,
 * have a look at the documentation of each function):
 *
 * @li writeStdin()
 *  -- Transmit data to the child process' stdin. When all data was sent, the
 * signal wroteStdin() is emitted.
 *
 * @li When data arrives at stdout or stderr, the signal receivedStdout()
 * resp. receivedStderr() is emitted.
 *
 * @li You can shut down individual communication channels with
 * closeStdin(), closeStdout(), and closeStderr(), resp.
