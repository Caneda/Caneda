Description
===========

Qucs is a circuit simulator with graphical user interface.  The
software aims to support all kinds of circuit simulation types,
e.g. DC, AC, S-parameter and harmonic balance analysis.  For
details see homepage:

http://qucs.sourceforge.net


Requirements
============

Qucs needs Qt(R) by Trolltech(R) <http://www.trolltech.com>.
This current version is known to work with Qt 3.1 and later.


Installation
============

Unpack the distribution tarball:

    $ tar xvzf qucs-<version>.tar.gz               (using GNU tar)
    $ gzip -cd qucs-<version>.tar.gz | tar xvf -   (using another tar)
  
Change into the source directory:

    $ cd qucs-<version>

Configure the source package for your system:

    $ ./configure

Now compile the package:

    $ make

Install Qucs:

    $ make install

You must have root privileges if you want to install the package in the
standard location (/usr/local) or in any location that is only writable 
by root.

For further information on installing the package, please consult the
file INSTALL included in this distribution.

Please note:  Users of the FreeBSD OS may use a GNU make (probably gmake)
to compile and install the package.

Getting the latest CVS snapshot
===============================

You can always get the latest Qucs version from our CVS repository.
Please use an official release if you want to work with Qucs.  The CVS
version might not even compile.

 $ cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@qucs.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/qucs \
   co qucs

Press 'Enter' when asked for a password.  Run `sh autogen.sh' and
`configure' with the appropriate options.  Maintainance currently
requires Autoconf version 2.57 and GNU automake 1.7.0.
