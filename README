Description
===========

Caneda is an open source EDA software focused on easy of use and portability.
Caneda's goal is the complete design proccess from schematic capture, through
simulation and into circuit layout and PCB. While in the short term schematic
capture and simulation is the primary goal, in the long term future, PCB and
layout edition will be covered. The software aims to support all kinds of
circuit simulation types, e.g. DC, AC, S-parameter and harmonic balance
analysis.

For details visit the project's homepage:

https://github.com/Caneda/Caneda


Requirements
============

In order to compile Caneda sources, you will need the following libraries
installed in your system:

  * Qt
  * Cmake
  * Qwtplot


Getting the latest git snapshot
===============================

You can always get the latest Caneda version from our git repository. Please
use an official release if you want to work with Caneda.  The git version might
not even compile.

  $ git clone https://github.com/Caneda/Caneda


Installation
============

These are generic installation instructions.

If you need to do unusual things to compile the package, please try to figure
out how `cmake' could check whether to do them, and mail diffs or instructions
to the authors so they can be considered for the next release.

Unpack the distribution tarball:

  $ tar xvzf caneda-<version>.tar.gz

Change into the source directory:

  $ cd caneda-<version>

Create a new directory for Cmake to work in:

  $ mkdir build

Change into the recently created directory:

  $ cd build

Configure the source package for your system:

  $ cmake ../

Compile the package:

  $ make

Install Caneda:

  $ make install

You must have root privileges if you want to install the package in the
standard location (/usr/local) or in any location that is only writable by
root.

Please note:  Users of the FreeBSD OS may use a GNU make (probably gmake) to
compile and install the package.


Compilers and Options
=====================

Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that `cmake'
does not know about.  Run `./cmake --help' for details on some of the pertinent
environment variables.

You can give `cmake' initial values for configuration parameters by setting
variables in the command line or in the environment.  Here is an example:

  $ ./cmake CC=c89 CFLAGS=-O2 LIBS=-lposix


Installation Directory
======================

By default, `make install' will install the package's files in
`/usr/local/bin', `/usr/local/man', etc.  You can specify an installation
prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving `cmake' the option `--prefix=PATH'.

You can specify separate installation prefixes for architecture-specific files
and architecture-independent files.  If you give `cmake' the option
`--exec-prefix=PATH', the package will use PATH as the prefix for installing
programs and libraries. Documentation and other data files will still use the
regular prefix.

In addition, if you use an unusual directory layout you can give options like
`--bindir=PATH' to specify different values for particular kinds of files.


Doxygen Documentation
=====================

Caneda uses Doxygen as its developers code documentation. To generate the
doxygen documentation, use the Doxyfile file provided at the source's root.
