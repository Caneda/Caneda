	strings were not really translatable, thus I changed them into
	QObject::tr() strings.  These are now translatable.

	* helpdialog.cpp (HelpDialog): Added a FIXME.  Possible use
	of translated documentation.

	* docs/Makefile.am, docs/en/Makefile.am: Corrected these.

	* Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): Added docs sub directory and fixed
	Michael's additions.

	of bitmaps.

	* qucsdoc.cpp (QucsDoc): Made much more string representations
	translatable.

	* qucs.cpp (initActions): Remove "bitmaps/" from hardcoded
	bitmap locations.  BITMAPDIR now contains the full-qualified
	location.
	Made much more string representations translatable.

	* main.cpp (main): Using LANGUAGEDIR instead of ".".

	* Makefile.am (langdata_DATA): Added translation installation
