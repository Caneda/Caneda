	* bitmaps/Makefile.am (picdatadir): Adjusted installation path
	of bitmaps.

	* qucsdoc.cpp (QucsDoc): Made much more string representations
	translatable.

	* qucs.cpp (initActions): Remove "bitmaps/" from hardcoded
	bitmap locations.  BITMAPDIR now contains the full-qualified
	location.
	Made much more string representations translatable.

	* main.cpp (main): Using LANGUAGEDIR instead of ".".

	* Makefile.am (langdata_DATA): Added translation installation
	path.
