	* bitmaps/Makefile.am (XPMS): Added missing pixmaps.

	* qucs_de.ts: Reverting last (wrong) patch and adding new
	translations.

2004-02-03  Stefan Jahn  <stefan@lkcc.org>

	* newprojdialog.cpp (NewProjDialog): For some reason tr() 
	strings were not really translatable, thus I changed them into
	QObject::tr() strings.  These are now translatable.

2004-01-29  Stefan Jahn  <stefan@lkcc.org>

	* paintings/Makefile.am, diagrams/Makefile.am,
	components/Makefile.am (INCLUDES): Fixed include path for

	* fileshowdialog.cpp, settingsdialog.cpp: Added translatable 
	strings.

	files to make 'make distcheck' working again.

	* helpdialog.cpp (HelpDialog): Added a FIXME.  Possible use
	of translated documentation.

	* docs/Makefile.am, docs/en/Makefile.am: Corrected these.
	Made documentation installable.

	* Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): Added docs sub directory and fixed
	Michael's additions.

	of bitmaps.

	* qucsdoc.cpp (QucsDoc): Made much more string representations
	translatable.

	* qucs.cpp (initActions): Remove "bitmaps/" from hardcoded
	bitmap locations.  BITMAPDIR now contains the full-qualified
	location.
	Made much more string representations translatable.

	* main.cpp (main): Using LANGUAGEDIR instead of ".".

	* Makefile.am (langdata_DATA): Added translation installation
	path.

2003-10-30  Stefan Jahn  <jahn@mwt.ee.tu-berlin.de>
