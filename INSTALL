Description
===========

Caneda is a circuit eda softwre with graphical user interface.  The
software aims to support all kinds of circuit simulation types,
e.g. DC, AC, S-parameter and harmonic balance analysis.  For
details see homepage:

http://caneda.tuxfamily.org


Requirements
============

Caneda needs Qt(R) by Trolltech(R) <http://www.trolltech.com>.
This current version is known to work with Qt 4.5 and later.


Installation
============

   These are generic installation instructions.

   If you need to do unusual things to compile the package, please try
to figure out how `cmake' could check whether to do them, and mail
diffs or instructions to the authors so they can be considered for the
next release.

Unpack the distribution tarball:

    $ tar xvzf caneda-<version>.tar.gz               (using GNU tar)
    $ gzip -cd caneda-<version>.tar.gz | tar xvf -   (using another tar)
  
Change into the source directory:

    $ cd caneda-<version>

Configure the source package for your system:

    $ cmake

Now compile the package:

    $ make

Install Caneda:

    $ make install

You must have root privileges if you want to install the package in the
standard location (/usr/local) or in any location that is only writable 
by root.

Please note:  Users of the FreeBSD OS may use a GNU make (probably gmake)
to compile and install the package.

Getting the latest git snapshot
===============================

You can always get the latest Caneda version from our git repository.
Please use an official release if you want to work with Caneda.  The git
version might not even compile.

    $ git clone git://git.tuxfamily.org/gitroot/caneda/caneda.git

Press 'Enter' when asked for a password.

Compilers and Options
=====================

   Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that
`cmake' does not know about.  Run `./cmake --help' for details on some
of the pertinent environment variables.

   You can give `cmake' initial values for configuration parameters
by setting variables in the command line or in the environment.  Here
is an example:

     ./cmake CC=c89 CFLAGS=-O2 LIBS=-lposix

   *Note Defining Variables::, for more details.

Installation Names
==================

   By default, `make install' will install the package's files in
`/usr/local/bin', `/usr/local/man', etc.  You can specify an
installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving `cmake' the
option `--prefix=PATH'.

   You can specify separate installation prefixes for
architecture-specific files and architecture-independent files.  If you
give `cmake' the option `--exec-prefix=PATH', the package will use
PATH as the prefix for installing programs and libraries.
Documentation and other data files will still use the regular prefix.

   In addition, if you use an unusual directory layout you can give
options like `--bindir=PATH' to specify different values for particular
kinds of files.  Run `configure --help' for a list of the directories
you can set and what kinds of files go in them.

   If the package supports it, you can cause programs to be installed
with an extra prefix or suffix on their names by giving `configure' the
option `--program-prefix=PREFIX' or `--program-suffix=SUFFIX'.
